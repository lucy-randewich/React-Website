## About this project
Website for a mock coffee company called Rover Roasts. I built this site as a challenge to learn React in under two hours - the result of this challenge can be seen in the initial commit of this repository. I plan to learn more and built upon it to make it more pretty and interactive!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
